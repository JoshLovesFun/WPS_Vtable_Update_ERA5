# This Vtable is designed to be used with the ERA5 data provided on single levels and pressure levels by the
# Climate Data Store (CDS) at the following 2 links:
# Single Level Data: https://cds.climate.copernicus.eu/datasets/reanalysis-era5-single-levels?tab=overview
# Pressure Level Data: https://cds.climate.copernicus.eu/datasets/reanalysis-era5-pressure-levels?tab=overview
#
# Grib codes are from ECMWF Parameter Database: https://codes.ecmwf.int/grib/param-db/
# Note that some of the above parameters do not have a description written in the "metgrid Description" column
# because we do not want to write these fields to the intermediate files.
#
# In rrpr.F:
# "HGT" is calculated from "GEOPT"
# "SOILHGT" is calculated from "SOILGEO"
# "RH" (at 2 m) is calculated from "DEWPT"
# "SNOW" is calculated from "SNOW_EC"
#
# ERA5 is based on 4D-Var data assimilation using Cycle 41r2 of the Integrated Forecasting System (IFS),
# which was operational at ECMWF in 2016.
#
# The names of all the parameters listed in the table above (that need to be downloaded from the CDS) have the
# following human readable names associated with their ID (first column) in the CDS:
#
# Pressure Levels:
# 129 = Geopotential
# 130 = Temperature
# 131 = U-component of wind
# 132 = V-component of wind
# 157 = Relative humidity
#
# Single Levels:
# 165 = 10m u-component of wind
# 166 = 10m v-component of wind
# 167 = 2m temperature
# 168 = 2m dewpoint temperature
# 172 = Land-sea mask
# 129 = Geopotential
# 134 = Surface pressure
# 151 = Mean sea level pressure
# 235 = Skin temperature
#  31 = Sea-ice cover
#  34 = Sea surface temperature
# 141 = Snow depth
# 139 = Soil temperature level 1
# 170 = Soil temperature level 2
# 183 = Soil temperature level 3
# 236 = Soil temperature level 4
#  39 = Volumetric soil water layer 1
#  40 = Volumetric soil water layer 2
#  41 = Volumetric soil water layer 3
#  42 = Volumetric soil water layer 4
